## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Unified Scanner interface for pluggable detectors (`Scanner`, `ScanResult`, `ScanDecision`)
- `PromptInjectionScanner` — 50 patterns across 6 attack categories, decision-based output (ALLOW / HITL / BLOCK)
- `SecretsScanner` — 110 patterns across AWS, GCP, Azure, GitHub, Slack, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, and more; Shannon entropy detection for high-entropy tokens
- `PiiScanner` — 27 patterns with Luhn credit-card validation and IBAN mod-97 check
- `Vault` — placeholder-based redact/restore with 4 strategies (exact, caseInsensitive, fuzzy, combined)
- `scanAll` / `scan_all` composite scanner (JS + Python) — runs all scanners in one call
- 4 new MCP tools: `check_prompt_injection`, `scan_secrets`, `scan_pii`, `redact_pii`, `restore_pii` (total MCP tool count: 24)
- Python parity for all new scanners (`PromptInjectionScanner`, `SecretsScanner`, `PiiScanner`, `Vault`, `scan_all`)
- VS Code extension scaffold (`packages/vscode-extension`, v0.1.0)
- Gradio Hugging Face Space (`packages/huggingface-space`) — 5-tab multi-scanner demo
- Benchmark shootout CI gate (`benchmarks/shootout/`) — F1 regression guard vs obscenity, bad-words, leo-profanity, @2toad/profanity

### Changed
- Scanner implementations live at `glin-profanity/scanners` subpath export to keep core bundle unchanged; root entry exports types only
- `ScanMatch.category` now carries pattern family (e.g. `"stripe"`, `"aws_access_key"`) instead of severity

### Fixed
- PI-034 missing `/i` flag (only matched ALL-CAPS variants)
- PI-036 removed negative lookbehind for broader runtime support (Safari, older Node)
- Overlapping match range deduplication in secrets redaction

## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-30

### Changed
- Removed legacy release workflow in favor of streamlined CI/CD
- Version bump for npm publishing improvements

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-30

### Added

#### Leetspeak Detection
- New `detectLeetspeak` option to catch obfuscated profanity like `f4ck`, `@ss`, `$h!t`
- Three intensity levels: `basic`, `moderate`, `aggressive`
- Detects spaced characters (`f u c k`) and repeated characters (`fuuuuck`)

#### Unicode Normalization
- New `normalizeUnicode` option (enabled by default)
- Detects Cyrillic/Greek lookalikes (e.g., `fυck` with Greek upsilon)
- Handles zero-width characters, full-width characters, and homoglyphs
- Two-pass normalization to prevent Scunthorpe problem (false positives)

#### Result Caching
- New `cacheResults` option for 800x performance improvement on repeated checks
- LRU eviction with configurable `maxCacheSize` (default: 1000)
- Cache management methods: `getCacheSize()`, `clearCache()`

#### ML Integration (Optional)
- TensorFlow.js-powered toxicity detection via `glin-profanity/ml` module
- `ToxicityDetector` class for standalone ML analysis
- `HybridFilter` class combining rule-based and ML detection
- Detects: toxicity, insults, threats, identity attacks, obscene content, severe toxicity
- Configurable threshold and combination modes

#### New Languages
- Added Dutch language support
- Fixed Turkish dictionary

### Changed
- Improved Filter class with configuration export/import
- Enhanced performance benchmarks
- Better TypeScript type definitions

### Fixed
- Scunthorpe problem (false positives like "Scunthorpe", "assassin")
- Repeated character handling in edge cases
- User ignoreWords now properly merge with global whitelist
